<p>My name is Cole.  I am a recent graduate of Lamar University's Galloway College of Business. I was there on a full scholarship to play on the football team, which I did for all three of the years I was there. I also joined the track team my senior year, although my career was short-lived due to Covid-19. Shortly before graduating, I decided to enroll at SMU's Web Development bootcamp to learn full-stack development. </p>
